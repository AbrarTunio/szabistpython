a = 15

x = a / b  #In divsion output is always float
y = a * b  # If both are int the output would be int
z = a * b  # if any one or both are float then output would be float

name = "Simran"
# result = name + 5  # this will generate error

# finale = value2 + value1

# You can not apply division / sub or floor or mod to strings
# strings can be multiplied to ints
# strings would be concatenated with +
